# ECEN-766-Final-Project-Energy-Consumption-Forecasting
Energy Consumption Forecasting ML Project Data and Codes
A project by William Appelt, Hamzah Issa, and Adriana Matos Almodovar
This project develops a Transformer-based machine learning model to forecast short-term and long-term energy demand using historical weather data from NOAA and energy load data from ERCOT. The goal is to empower energy providers with more accurate predictions, enabling better planning, cost optimization, and grid reliability.

Objective: Predict future electricity demand using a Transformer architecture trained on weather and energy usage data.

Data Sources:

> NOAA: Hourly/daily weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar irradiance.

> ERCOT: Historical load data across various regions in Texas, including system-wide and zonal demand.

Model Architecture: Custom Transformer model tailored for time-series regression tasks with attention mechanisms to handle seasonal trends, anomalies, and temporal dependencies.

Applications:

> Energy generation planning

> Demand-side management

> Load balancing and pricing strategies
